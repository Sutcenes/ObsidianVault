Russell, Principles of Mathematics, 1903 [[russel-1903]]
>So long as any term in our proposition can be turned into a variable, our proposition can be generalized; and so long as this is possible, it is the business of mathematics to do it.

>Thus pure mathematics must contain no indefinables except logical constants, and consequently no premisses, or indemonstrable propositions, but such as are concerned exclusively with logical constants and with variables.

>The distinction of mathematics from logic is very arbitrary

Pour Russel la distinction Math-Logique est nulle.
Poincaré s'y oppose et soulève [[le problème des mathématiques formelles]].

[[Formalisme Logique]]
