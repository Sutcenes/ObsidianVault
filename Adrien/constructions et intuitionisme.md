Arend Heyting, Intuitionism: An Introduction (1956) [[heyting-1956]]
>There is a criterion by which we are able to recognize mathematical assertions as such. Every mathematical assertion can be expressed in the form: “I have effected the construction A in my mind”.
>
  A mathematical proposition p always demands a mathematical construction with certain given properties; it can be asserted as soon as such a construction has been carried out. We say in this case that the construction proves the proposition p and call it a *proof* of p. 
>
>It will be necessary to fix, as firmly as possible, the meaning of the [intuitionistic](Intuitionisme) logical connectives; I do this by giving necessary and sufficient conditions under which a complex expression can be asserted.

Heyting identifie la proposition, sa démontration et son contenu. Pour être énoncée convenablement, une expression mathématique doit donc :

>p ∧ q can be asserted if and only if both p and q can be asserted. 
>
>p ∨ q can be asserted if and only if at least one of the propositions p and q can be asserted. 
>
>Then ¬p can be asserted if and only if we possess a construction which from the supposition that a construction p were carried out, leads to a contradiction.. . . I think that contradiction must be taken as a primitive notion. . . it is always easy to recognize a contradiction as such.

Ici l'intuitionisme considère la contraction comme une base nécessaire aux mathématiques. En un sens, le tiers exclus est remplacé par la contractidiction ([[intuitionisme et négation]]).

>The implication p → q can be asserted, if and only if we possess a construction r, which, joined to any construction proving p (supposing that the latter be effected), would automatically effect a construction proving q. In other words, a proof of p, together with r, would form a proof of q.
