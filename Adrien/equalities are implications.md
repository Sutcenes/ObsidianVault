>Elementary Arithmetic might be thought to form an exception: 1+1=2 appears neither to contain variables nor to assert an implication. But as a matter of fact, as will be shown in Part II, the true meaning of this proposition is: “If x is one and y is one, and x differs from y, then x and y are two.” And this proposition both contains variables and asserts an implication. We shall find always, in all mathematical propositions, that the words any or some occur; and these words are the marks of a variable and a formal implication. Thus the above proposition may be expressed in the form: “Any unit and any other unit are two units.”

Cette approche permet de maintenir la vérité des propositions mathématiques indépendemment du contenu des variables utilisées.

>Thus, for example, the proposition “x and y are numbers implies (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y² ” holds equally if for x and y we substitute Socrates and Plato: both hypothesis and consequent, in this case, will be false, but the implication will still be true. Thus in every proposition of pure mathematics, when fully stated, the variables have an absolutely unrestricted field: any conceivable entity may be substituted for any one of our variables without impairing the truth of our proposition.

Ici, comme Socrate et Platon ne sont pas des nombres, chaque hypothèse est fausse et l'implication demeure donc vraie.
